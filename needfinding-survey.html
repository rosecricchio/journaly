      <h2>Survey</h2>
      <p>Our needfinding began with a survey shared to various Facebook groups including the HCI Spring 2019 group and the  Class Year 2019, 2020, and 2021 groups. We expect, based on the groups the survey was sent to, that most if not all respondents are University of Rochester students. Our goals for the survey were to get a gauge of what students thought about their own stress levels, coping methods they found valuable, and their opinion on journaling and our project idea.</p>

      <p>Seventy-five survey responses were recorded. Results are detailed below.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A large majority (90%) of students reported their stress levels as "moderate" or higher, with none reporting "very low".</li>
              <li>About half of students reported feeling moderately equipped to deal with stress, with only 19% feeling more confident.</li>
              <li>A majority (63%) of respondents felt that their access to mental health resources such as counseling was at least adequate.</li>
              <li>The greatest barrier reported to students using mental health resources was lack of time, followed by lack of access, stigma, and financial concerns.</li>
