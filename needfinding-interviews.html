      <h2>Interviews</h2>

      <div>Another aspect of needfinding we wanted to include was interviews with professionals, such as psychology professors or counselors who might have insight as to the benefits of journaling specifically or other coping techniques they use with their patients. We sent questions out to a few different individuals, but only ended up getting one respondent.</div><br>

      <h3>Jaclyn Kearns</h3>

      <div>We interviewed Jaclyn Kearns, a doctoral student at the U of R whose research focuses primarily on "executive function and emotion regulation deficits that may indicate individuals' move from suicidal thoughts to suicidal behavior". As such, she works mainly with high-risk patients, and mentioned to us: </div><br>

      <div>"I don’t think I am the best person to answer these questions for two reasons-
        <ol>
          <li>the majority of my patients are high-risk for suicide and/or with severe psychopathology so I practice within very structured treatment protocols;</li>
          <li>I don’t know the empirical evidence behind journaling and I have never suggested it to my patients."</li>
        </ol>
      </div><br>


      <div>This does highlight the fact that our product is not meant to replace traditional therapy methods and will likely be the most relevant to individuals who are not high-risk. We were nevertheless appreciative of Jackie's responses and the insight they gave as to how she works with patients. Our questions and her responses are detailed below.</div><br>

      
      <div class="tile is-ancestor">
        <div class="tile is-parent">
          <article class="tile is-child box">

            <div class="question">Do you suggest journaling to patients/students? If so, what causes you to suggest it
            (specified disorders or certain criteria/personality)?</div><br>

            <div>"I don’t think I have ever I suggest journaling to patients that I treat. I practice
            within structured therapies such as the Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic
            Treatment of Emotion Disorders, Dialectal Behavior Therapy, and Prolonged
            Exposure Therapy for PTSD. All of these therapies fall under the umbrella of
            Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.</div><br>
            <div>"I may not be the best fit for providing information or insight on journaling as the
            majority of the patients I see are high-risk for suicide and/or with severe
            psychopathology; journaling isn’t something I would suggest for the type of
            patients that I see. I give my patients homework to practice skills that we have
            learned in-session (e.g., breathing exercises for PTSD treatment) as that will
            enhance what we cover in session.</div><br>
            <div>"To get a better response, I might seek out someone who sees lower risk patients.
            Maybe reach out to someone at the University Counseling Center (UCC)? I would
            reach out the Brigid Cahill, PhD and ask her to suggest a counselor at UCC that
            you could speak to about this. I think someone at UCC may be more well-versed
            in this intervention than I am."</div><br>

            <div class="question">Do you see the benefits of journaling in your patients? If so, what are they?</div><br>
            <div>"Journaling may be helpful for patients to understand the processes (e.g., thoughts,
            behaviors) and environmental factors that may underlie or contribute to their
            current symptoms or distress. However, this is merely a hypothesis - I don’t know
            the empirical evidence surrounding journaling as an intervention or adjunct
            intervention for patients with diagnosed psychiatric disorders. This is information
            that I would seek out in empirical literature. A librarian at UR could help you
            search empirical journals for evidence on possible benefits."</div><br>

            <div class="question">What other techniques do you suggest to your patients to try at home?</div><br>
            <div>"Depending on what their diagnosis is, I often suggest the following: mindfulness-
            based exercises (e.g., meditation – can be completed with a phone app or a
            YouTube video), breathing exercises, dysfunctional thought logs (to help patients
            recognize “thinking traps”, to generate evidence for/against the thought, and to
            come up with alternative explanations), emotion induction exercises (to help
            patients practice being fully aware of your emotional experiences as they are
            occurring right now in the present moment, without labeling or judging), and
            various skills from dialectical behavior therapy (typically for patients that are at
            high-risk for suicide or patients who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury)."</div><br>
            
            <div class="question">Can you think of anything we have not included that would be beneficial to our
            users?</div>
            <div>"Resources related to suicide prevention (see below), resources to find a therapist
            (see below), and other crisis-related resources (see below)."</div><br>
